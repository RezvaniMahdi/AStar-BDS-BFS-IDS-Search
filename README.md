# AStar-BDS-BFS-IDS-Search

the problem that we try to solved is a math game. This game consists of an n Ã— m matrix .
one of the house is the starting house of the game and another house is the target house of the game. At
The starting house is your initial score. You must start with the beginning of the house, so you move in the matrix
until you arrive to the target house and your score must be higher than the score written in the target house.
Also, note that you can only go through each of the game houses once.

On this project we solved this this math game(problem) with different search algorithm like Astar and BFS and .... .
